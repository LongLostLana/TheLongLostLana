            <p>My dad is 57 and he is serious most of the time. He is very kind though. 
                He is thoughtful towards others and always thinks of other before himself. 
                My mom is also the same but is has a very bright personality. She wears 
                the brightest clothing, with flower headbands, and loves the color RED! She 
                is the most creative person I know. She would make her frames for photos out 
                of ribbons, buttons, and feathers. She would always sing songs but don’t know 
                the lyrics. And has the most kind heart in this whole world. My brother is the 
                sweetest little boy ever. He is 16 and he has down-syndrome. He is super smart 
                and can breakdance very well. He knows hip-hop and knows jiu jitsu. He is so kind 
                and doesn't let anything stop him. I love my sister! She is the most ambitious, 
                loveable, crazy, creative, silly person I’ll ever know. We are basically best 
                friends more than sisters. We both share the same dream of traveling the world 
                and trying different food. She is a musician and singer that plays everywhere. 
                She has traveled all over the U.S. and she is currently in Israel right now with 
                her boyfriend. She is a very talented person and is super pretty. I look up to 
                my sister all the time.

            <p>One of my hobbies is volleyball. I play at a club called New Wave Volleyball 
                Club. I have been playing for 2 years now and plan to keep going. I also like to shop
                 at Pacsun, Forever 21, and others. Other hobbies are hanging out with my siblings, 
                 cleaning my house, and reading. I also  really enjoy volleyball and tennis. Volleyball 
                 is my favorite sport and I like to play tennis with my family. I love to travel around
                  Long Beach, go to local coffee shops, and hang out by Shoreline Village with my mom.

            <p> I am very talented at the keyboard. I can write 55 wpm. I also play volleyball and plan 
                to tryout for high school. My GPA is great at 4.0 and I like to digital art and like to 
                make websites. I am also a good photographer. I’m very organized and like to get my work
                completed before the time limit.
